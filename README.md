# Dogs vs Cats CNN

This repository was created as the final project for the Deep Learning Bootcamp organized by Global AI Hub in collaboration with Akbank. The dataset used is Dogs vs Cats from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model that can classify whether an image is a dog or a cat.

# Metrics

Actual performance metrics: 84.78% vs 75.30%

Visualization metrics: Confusion matrix, classification report

# Notes

Since I developed this project on Kaggle, if you want to run it locally, you will need to update the data paths.

# Conclusion and Future Work

I compared the effect of different learning rates (0.001 vs 0.0001). Using 0.0001 resulted in higher accuracy. For further improvements, **Dropout rates** and **Activation** functions can be experimented with.
